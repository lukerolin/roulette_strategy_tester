Romanovsky Roulette Method Tester

A simple program that allows the user to input how much money they start with, 
how much they are willing to lose and what increment chips they will use. 
This tests the Romanovsky roulette method and simulates 1000 'games' by 
either reaching your goal or falling below the losing threshold.
